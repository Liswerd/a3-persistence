This application is the same as before from project 2, and used the implimentation of cookies along with the use of the mongo database. It is a calculator that an individual is able to pick kinds of calculations they wish to make from a starting grand total value, and delete the lastest row inserted in case a mistake was made within the calculations. This was the easiest to impliment as well as the help I was able to recieve form the multiple TA's at office hours reccomended the use of this, so that is how I was able to complete the assignemnt. I had a very simple CSS base framework that changed a few of the things such as slightly altering the size of some of the text as well as realigning parts of the page to help with the lighthouse testing, mostly changing the font to be personally more readable. 


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1 - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com)**: I chose to hold the side on Digital Ocean, which to be honest was a lot more difficult than using glitch. There was a lot of implimentation setup, however it did allow the safety of my site along with the use on digital frameworks being implimented by my erpsonal discretion, since if something was messed up I knew it was something that I would have coded and nothin at fault through the host. 

- **Tech Achievement 2 - Light House**: Get 100% in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.

- **Tech Achievement 3 - 3 Express Packages used**:
In total, there wewre 3 that I used within the server and script. I used cookies, which allowed the implimentation of a username that could be remembered as the site was being set up along with the use of having a username listed at the top of the calculation page. 
I as well used body-parser, which is able to parse incoming bodies before they are visible to the handlers, which made implimentation of recieving data from the database simpler. 
Lastly, I used path, which this allowed for additional routing paths that the site would be able to redirect you from the index page to a proper calculate page.
